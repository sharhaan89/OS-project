            <p>
                First Fit allocates the first available memory block that is large enough to accommodate the process. It starts searching from the beginning of the memory and assigns the process to the first block that meets the size requirement. This technique is simple and efficient but can lead to significant fragmentation.

        <div class="bestfit">
            <h3 class="heading">Best Fit</h3>
            <p>
                Best Fit allocates the smallest available memory block that is just large enough
                to hold the process. It searches through the entire memory and selects the block
                that results in the smallest amount of wasted space. This technique
                reduces fragmentation, but it requires more time for searching the entire memory.

        <div class="worstfit">
            <h3 class="heading">Worst Fit</h3>
            <p>
                Worst Fit allocates the largest available memory block to the process. It searches through the entire memory and
                assigns the process to the largest block, leaving behind a larger amount of wasted space. This techniqu
                increases fragmentation but can be useful when large processes need to be
                allocated.

            <h3 class="heading">Next Fit</h3>
            <p>
            Next Fit is an extension of the First Fit technique that starts searching for
            the next available block from the location where the previous allocation took
            place. It reduces the search time compared to First Fit as it continues the
            search from the last allocated
            position. However, it may still result in fragmentation similar to First Fit.
