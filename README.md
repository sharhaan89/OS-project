# OS-project

<b>OS Visualizer</b> is an educational tool designed to help students understand complex operating system concepts through interactive visualizations. Our platform offers simulations of various algorithms used in operating systems, making abstract concepts more tangible and easier to comprehend. <br>

This project was developed as part of our Operating Systems course to provide a hands-on learning experience for students. By visualizing algorithms like process scheduling, memory management, and disk scheduling, we aim to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical understanding. <br><br>
